# casual-languge-modeling
This repository create a custom Causal Lanaguge model (Auto regressive model) for Python code generation. 

Steps:
1. Create a custom tokenizer for Python lanaguage to handle all the nuances in the code. 
2. Dataset used for tokenizer and model training is CodeSearchNet/Python. This dataset has ~450K training examples. 
3. Use GPT2 architecture to CLM.
